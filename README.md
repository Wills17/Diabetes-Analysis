# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This Python project focuses on predicting if a patient has diabetes using a precompiled dataset. It includes a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of multiple prediction models. Cross-validation is implemented during each model prediction to ensure robust and reliable results.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Or use "pip3" if your installed python version is python3.0 or greater

```bash
pip3 install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Run each script to execute the analysis and predictions. The script provides an overview of the dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, applies various prediction models, and ensures cross-validation for each model. Feel free to customize the script according to your specific project details.

## Overview of Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to diabetes. The main.py script provides a detailed overview of the dataset, including key statistics and visualizations to help understand the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes an in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. EDA is crucial for gaining insights into the data and informing the choice of prediction models.

## Prediction Models

Multiple prediction models are applied to forecast diabetes outcomes. The script leverages popular machine learning models available in scikit-learn. The results of each model are cross-validated to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Cross Validation

Cross-validation is also implemented during each prediction model to evaluate its performance and ensure robustness. This technique helps in obtaining a more accurate estimate of the model's effectiveness on an independent dataset.

## Notes

Feel free to customize and extend the script based on your specific requirements. Additionally, documentation for each function or module within the project can be added to enhance understanding and maintainability.
